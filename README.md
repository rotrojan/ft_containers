# ft_containers

42 project aiming to implement four of the containers of the Standard Template Library (`vector`, `stack`, `map` and `set`) in C++98.

## Concerns
- Compliance with the ISO C++98 standard (class attributes and member functions, algorithmic complexities);
- Usage of the appropriate data structures (red-black trees and arrays).

Includes an auto-testing Makefile.
